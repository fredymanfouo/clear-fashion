## 🤔 Problems

Clear Fashion is particularly committed to ensuring that there are **no conflicts due to commercial interests**.

My problem is simple and time-consuming: **I cannot consult on the same page all the products of my favorite brands.**

I have to browse each e-shop brand to look for a product.
